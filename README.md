# CSE110_Project
Fresh repository with main branch.

To run GameScreen:

npm install  

First time running: cd backend and then mkdir data  

Need two different terminals, one running backend & other frontend

Backend:
Go to /backend/src/data
Run npx tsx question_db.ts
Go to /backend/src
Run npx ts-node server.ts

Frontend:
Go to /frontend
npm run dev  

Game will open on browser.  


To run LoginScreen:  
First time running: cd backend and then mkdir data    
If you have MacOS, on the terminal, you go to the frontend folder and run: npm run dev  

In another terminal, you go to the backend folder and run: npm start  

If you have windows, make sure to change the terminal to be WSL
